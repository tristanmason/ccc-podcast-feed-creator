# ccc-podcast-feed-creator

This Wordpress plugin was created for a specific website. It makes an iTunes- and Google Play-friendly podcast feed out of the Vamtam Church & Event theme wpv_sermon custom post type.

## Getting Started

This is a custom plugin created for a specific website. You will have to modify many things about it for it to work on a different site, but I hope it can function as an example for rolling your own.

### Prerequisites

You will need a website running Vamtam Church & Event theme on Wordpress.

### Installing

Download the plugin, edit it to make it work in your environment, zip it, and upload to Wordpress.
